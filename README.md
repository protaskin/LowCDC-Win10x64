# LowCDC-Win10x64

This repo contains almost everything (except for the usbser.sys driver because of Microsoft Software License Terms) that is needed to create a lowcdc.sys driver package that can be installed on the 64-bit version of Windows 10. lowcdc.sys is published unchanged, the source code is available on the author's site (see [the Credits section](#credits)).

The driver package supports the following devices:

- AVR-CDC (`USB\VID_16C0&PID_05E1`),

- Digispark (`USB\VID_16D0&PID_087E`).

The master branch can be broken, use tags/releases in order to obtain stable releases.

## Why does not the lowcdc.sys driver install/work on Windows 10?

1. The lowcdc.inf installation script does not contain necessary sections (SourceDisksNames, SourceDisksFiles), the driver package does not contain a signed catalog file.

2. **[usbser.sys has been completely re-written in Windows 10](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/usbcoreblog/2015/07/29/what-is-new-with-serial-in-windows-10/) and cannot be used with the current version of the lowcdc.sys.**

3. [Beginning with the release of Windows 10, all new Windows 10 kernel mode drivers must be submitted to and digitally signed by the Windows Hardware Developer Center Dashboard portal](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/windows_hardware_certification/2015/04/01/driver-signing-changes-in-windows-10/).

## Getting Windows and the driver package ready

1. Find `usbser.sys` included in the 64-bit version of Windows 7. The file is located in the `\Sources\install.wim\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\mdmcpq.inf_amd64_neutral_fbc4a14a6a13d0c8\` folder on the installation disk of Windows 7 with integrated SP1. The version of the driver I use is 6.1.7601.17514. Copy the file to the driver package's folder and rename it to `usbser61.sys` to avoid replacement of the Windows 10 driver.

2. Install [Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit). Make sure that the `Inf2Cat` program is located in the `\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Bin\x86\` folder, the programs `MakeCert`, `CertMgr`, `SignTool` are located in the `\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Bin\x64\` folder. If any program is missing, try to install [Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk).

3. [Enable the TESTSIGNING boot configuration option](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/the-testsigning-boot-configuration-option), restart the computer for the change to take effect. When the option for test-signing is enabled Windows displays a watermark with the text "Test Mode", the version and build of Windows in the lower right-hand corner of the desktop. **Be aware using Windows with the TESTSIGNING boot configuration option, Windows will load any type of test-signed kernel-mode code.**

4. [Create a catalog file for the driver package](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/creating-a-catalog-file-for-a-pnp-driver-package).

5. [Create a MakeCert test certificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/makecert-test-certificate), [install the test certificate to corresponding certificate stores](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/using-certmgr-to-install-test-certificates-on-a-test-computer), [test-sign the driver package's catalog file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/test-signing-a-driver-package-s-catalog-file).

## Using createcat.bat

createcat.bat is a script that generates a test-signed catalog file for the driver package (performs the actions 4 and 5 from the list above).

The script does not need any configuration and ready for use. However you can change the name of a certificate (the `CertName` variable) or use an installed certificate (change the `CertName` variable, set `CreateCert=0`).

1. Run `createcat.bat` with the administrative permissions (it is not necessary to run the script in the command prompt).

2. Examine the output. The text below is the result of a successful execution.

createcat.bat generates the test-signed catalog file `lowcdc.cat` and creates the `certcopy.cer` file that contains a copy of the certificate.

## Troubleshooting

### Error 0x800B0101

```
SignTool Error: WinVerifyTrust returned error: 0x800B0101
        A required certificate is not within its validity period when verifying against the current system clock or the timestamp in the signed file.
```

Open `lowcdc.cat`, compare the singing time of the catalog file and the value of the certificate's 'valid from'. Adjust the system clock. Run `createcat.bat` again (do not delete `certcopy.cer`, the file is used to determine whether the certificate has been created and added to the certificate stores, otherwise set `CreateCert=0`).
